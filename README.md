## Analysis


-- 11)  Look at this customer recordâ€”do you see anything suspicious? 

-- Yes, during the time period in question (2011-2012), John Doeein only ever made one purchase and it was for the max total as shown in the above question. Also, the only personal information that exists in our database regarding this customer is their name which is extremely suspicious.


-- 12)  Who do you conclude is our primary person of interest?

-- John Doeein is our primary person of interest as we cannot be sure whether this transaction is 100% trustworthy (it may be fraudulent).
